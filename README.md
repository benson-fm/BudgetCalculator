# Purpose
This is a Python project that I worked on for about 2 weeks. I made this project so I could continue to enhance my skills in Python and also work on understanding OOP and Data Structures

# What It Does
This program allows you to make a budget and manipulate them. Below are the following features I added 
 - getter methods for budgets name, amount, all budgets, and history (including transaction dates)
 - ability to deposit and withdraw money (add/subtract to existing value)
 - transfer money from one budget to the other (changing the attributes from one object to instantly change another object)
 - determine percentage distributions from all total budgets and count how much money in total exists from all budgets

# Future Development
I plan on adding a GUI to the whole application, I'm currently getting used to the Tkinter library to add this in.
